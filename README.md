# Blank website using the aquarius CMS

This is a template that can be used to develop a website using the aquarius
CMS developed by [aquaverde GmbH](http://aquaverde.ch).


# Installation

Assuming you're using Debian or a derivative.

0. Become the webserver user 

        su www-data || sudo su www-data

1. Clone this repository to your webroot (this example assumes /var/www)

        git clone --recursive git://github.com/aquaverde/aquarius-blank.git /var/www

2. Enable maintenance mode

        /var/www/aquarius/core/bin/enable_maintenance 127.0.0.1

   This example assumes you'll be connecting from localhost.
3. Browse to http://localhost/aquarius/core/backend/setup.php

To do serious work, you'll want to change the origin-remote of the
repository to some other place, develop there, then push/pull changes to the
server when they're ready.


# Changing the site

Assuming the installation went well, you can browse 
http://localhost/aquarius/admin/ to administer the site. To actually work on the
site, you will have to modify the templates in /var/www/aquarius/templates.
