# Blank website using the aquarius CMS

This is a template that can be used to develop a website using the aquarius
CMS developed by [aquaverde GmbH](http://aquaverde.ch).


# Installation

0. Change to your webroot (this example uses /var/www)

        cd /var/www

1. Clone this repository to your webroot

        git clone --recursive git://github.com/aquaverde/aquarius-blank.git .

2. Enable maintenance mode by running

        aquarius/core/bin/enable_maintenance 127.0.0.1
   
   Assuming you'll be connecting from localhost. Instead, you may
   create the file AQUARIUS_MAINTENANCE.CASUAL
   
        touch aquarius/AQUARIUS_MAINTENANCE.CASUAL

   This too enables maintenance mode. The second method is less secure. Both
   methods will allow maintenance operations during two hours.

4. Ensure the Webserver has write-permissions on the aquarius-directory. This
   depends on your setup. It's easiest when the user you use to administer the
   files is the same as the webserver user.

3. Browse to http://localhost/aquarius/admin/setup.php to start setup.


# Changing the site

Assuming the installation went well, you can browse 
http://localhost/aquarius/admin/ to administer the site. To actually work on the
site, you will have to modify the templates in /var/www/aquarius/templates.

To do serious work, you'll want to change the origin-remote of the
repository to some other place, develop there, then push/pull changes to the
server when they're ready.


# Licence

Permission is granted to use these example files as you see fit, though some may
